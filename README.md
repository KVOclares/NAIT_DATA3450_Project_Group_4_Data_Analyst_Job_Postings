# NAIT_DATA3450_Project_Group_4_Data_Analyst_Job_Postings
The goal of the project is to explore a dataset, identify a story revealed by the data, and  prepare a report that tells that story compellingly, including effective data visualizations.

The target audience is other people in the class, or members of the general public with a 
comparable level of statistics knowledge. 
Format 
The goal of the project is to identify a problem – something that needs to be answered. You’ll 
then source some data, do your analysis, and interpret your results. A good way to phase this 
(borrowed from Allen Downey – the author of the ThinkStats book): 
• Q: motivating question; what is the purpose of the experiment? 
• M: methodology; how did you implement the experiment (at an appropriate level of 
detail)? 
• R: results; what happened when you ran the experiment? 
• I: interpretation; how do you interpret the result as an answer to the question? 
Note: The intent of this project is to be a realistic application of the concepts we covered this 
term. The exact set of tools and techniques that each of you use will be different – you’ll need 
to select the correct approach for your topic and your data, figure out how to apply it, and 
interpret the results.  
Topics and Data 
You may choose almost anything that suits your fancy. There are a few things to keep in mind 
when selecting a data source: 
• There should be an interesting question you’re answering. By interesting, I mean 
something that someone would talk about, write an article about, or use that 
information for some real purpose. 
• You want to demonstrate your mastery of the material – a question that is answered by 
simply taking an average or generating a histogram doesn’t. 
Deliverables 
You must show your idea and engage in a brief discussion. This is to ensure that you don’t 
choose something that wastes your time.  
You will turn in a Jupyter notebook file, containing: 
• Your contains the code, comments and explanatory text. 
• Commentary, in the text cells, that presents your question, methodology, results, and 
interpretation.  
• Someone should be able to read your notebook page start to end, and it should make 
sense and communicate everything.
